## Hello everyone! I'm Beatriz Santiago ðŸ˜„

A few years ago I got to know the IT world :sparkles: and have fallen in love with it ever since.
Currently, I dare to develop software on the client side :lipstick: and try to learn a little more about the server side. :construction::monocle_face:

My favorite application development <strong>stacks</strong> are [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/).
