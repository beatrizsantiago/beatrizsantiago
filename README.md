## Hello everyone! I'm Beatriz Santiago 😄

A few years ago, I discovered the world of IT ✨ and I've been in love with it ever since.
These days, I work on the client side 💄 and I'm also exploring the server side little by little 🛠️🧐

My favorite stacks for building applications include [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/).
